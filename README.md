# turtle-road-crossing-game
Basically turtle road crossing is a game where a turtle has to cross the road without getting hit by a car/vehicles.
Here, the twist in the game is that turtle cannot take left or right turn...it can walk only straight and pass the level 1
in the next level the randomly appearing vehicles speed gets faster and u can also track the highscore.
